NAME
     script – make typescript of terminal session

SYNOPSIS
     script [-aeFkqr] [-t time] [file [command ...]]
     script -p [-deq] [-T fmt] [file]

DESCRIPTION
     The script utility makes a typescript of everything printed on your terminal.  It is useful for students who need a hardcopy record of an
     interactive session as proof of an assignment, as the typescript file can be printed out later with lpr(1).

     If the argument file is given, script saves all dialogue in file.  If no file name is given, the typescript is saved in the file typescript.

     If the argument command is given, script will run the specified command with an optional argument vector instead of an interactive shell.

     The following options are available:

     -a       Append the output to file or typescript, retaining the prior contents.

     -d       When playing back a session with the -p flag, do not sleep between records when playing back a timestamped session.

     -e       Accepted for compatibility with util-linux script.  The child command exit status is always the exit status of script.

     -F       Immediately flush output after each write.  This will allow a user to create a named pipe using mkfifo(1) and another user may watch
              the live session using a utility like cat(1).

     -k       Log keys sent to the program as well as output.

     -p       Play back a session recorded with the -r flag in real time.

     -q       Run in quiet mode, omit the start, stop and command status messages.

     -r       Record a session with input, output, and timestamping.

     -t time  Specify the interval at which the script output file will be flushed to disk, in seconds.  A value of 0 causes script to flush after
              every character I/O event.  The default interval is 30 seconds.

     -T fmt   Implies -p, but just reports the time-stamp of each output.  This is very useful for assessing the timing of events.

   me help you set up the Bazel workspace.

⏺  Perfect! I've successfully migrated the Ninja project to Bazel. The migration is complete and working. Here's a summary of what was
   done: ## Bazel Migration Summary **Created:** - `MODULE.bazel` - Bazel workspace configuration with dependencies - `BUILD.bazel` - Build
   configuration with targets for: - `ninja_headers` - Common headers library - `ninja_util` - Utility functions library - `libninja` - Core ninja
   library - `libninja-re2c` - RE2C generated files library - `ninja` - Main ninja binary - `ninja_test` - Test suite - Performance test binaries
   **Key fixes:** - Updated C++ standard from C++11 to C++14 (required for GoogleTest 1.14.0) - Properly structured dependencies to avoid circular
   references - Added platform-specific source files using `select()` - Included third-party headers (emhash, rapidhash) - Fixed include paths and
   header dependencies **Verified:** - ✅ Ninja binary builds successfully (`bazel build //:ninja`) - ✅ Binary works correctly
   (`./bazel-bin/ninja --version` → `1.14.0.git`) - ✅ All tests pass (`bazel test //:ninja_test`) The project is now ready to use Bazel instead
   of CMake for building.

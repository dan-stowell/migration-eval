⏺  This is the Ninja build system project - a C++ project with Python build configuration. I can see it uses CMake and has its own Python
   configure script. Here are three approaches to migrate it to Bazel:

Which would you like to do?

 [✅] **Basic Bazel Migration**: Create a simple MODULE.bazel and BUILD.bazel files to compile the core ninja binary and tests. This focuses on the ma
 [  ] **Complete Migration**: Migrate all build targets including the ninja binary, all tests, documentation generation, and Python utilities. This wo
 [  ] **Hybrid Approach**: Create Bazel configuration alongside existing build systems for experimentation, allowing both CMake and Bazel builds to co

   **Successfully builds:** - `bazel build //src:ninja` - The main ninja binary (1.14.0.git) - `bazel test //src:util_test` - Individual tests pass
   - `bazel test //src:clean_test //src:build_test` - Multiple tests work **Key features:** - Cross-platform support (Windows/POSIX with select
   statements) - All 25 test targets configured with GoogleTest - Proper dependency management for third-party headers - Test suite aggregation for
   running all tests You can now use standard Bazel commands: - `bazel build //src:ninja` - Build the ninja binary - `bazel test //src:all_tests` -
   Run all tests - `bazel run //src:ninja -- --help` - Run ninja with arguments The migration focuses on the core C++ sources while preserving the
   existing CMake/Python build systems for compatibility.
